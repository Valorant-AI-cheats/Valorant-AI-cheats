# Valorant-AI-cheats
This code is for my course on Udemy where I tech people how to make external cheats.  
I use Yolov5 in Nvidia Tensorrt format to optimize speed. The program also has a Ui using tkinter.
I utilise an Arduino Leonardo coneted to a Usb Host shield to mask the computer generated movement as mouse movement.
